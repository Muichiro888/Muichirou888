                <h3>The Demon Slayer Corps plunges into the Infinity Castle to defeat Muzan. Shinobu engages in a fierce
                    fight against Doma, the Upper-Rank 2 demon. Poison doesn't work on him, so she finds herself in an
                    intense struggle. Will she be able to defeat the demon who killed her older sister?! Then another demon
                    appears before Zenitsu and blocks his way.
    
                    Tanjiro and Tomioka confront Akaza, the Upper-Rank 3 demon. Against Akaza's overwhelming strength, the
                    two find themselves unable to do anything but defend themselves. With the situation looking grim,
                    Tanjiro awakens to the "Transparent World" his father once told him about. Will this new knowledge allow
                    Tanjiro to turn the tables and go on the offensive against Akaza?
